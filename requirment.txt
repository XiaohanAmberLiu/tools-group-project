1) InstallationSince expedia and hotwire are static web page in which python can use a combination of libraries as requests and BeautifulSoup. We need to get the BeautifulSoup library using pip, a package management tool for python.We type:!pip install BeautifulSoupNote: If you fail to execute the above command line try adding sudo in front of each line.Since the remaining four web pages as priceline (flight), hipmunk (flight), Booking (hotel), Airbnb (hotel) are dynamic loading web pages in which python cannot scrape the complete source code of the web page, so we install a new library seleniumWe type:!pip install selenium2) ChromedriverIf we want to use selenium, you need to configure the corresponding browser driver for the machine. In this program we use Chromedriver. We can download it from this website: http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html . Chromedriver is unzipped and placed in a Python or other directory with environment variables configured.The test code and running results are as follows:From selenium import webdriverDriver = webdriver. Chrome()Driver.get(¡°http://www.google.com¡±)Print(Dirver.pag_source)3) Import packagesfrom selenium import webdriverfrom selenium.webdriver.common.by import Byfrom selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keysfrom selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as ECfrom selenium.webdriver.support.wait import WebDriverWaitfrom selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Optionsimport reimport timeimport jsonimport requestsfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoupfrom lxml import html
