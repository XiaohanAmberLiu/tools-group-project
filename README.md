### Installation Instruction:
1)	Installation

Since expedia and hotwire are static web page in which python can use a combination of libraries as requests and BeautifulSoup. We need to get the BeautifulSoup library using pip, a package management tool for python.
We type:

```
!pip install BeautifulSoup

```

Note: If you fail to execute the above command line try adding sudo in front of each line.

Since the remaining four web pages as priceline (flight), hipmunk (flight), Booking (hotel), Airbnb (hotel) are dynamic loading web pages in which python cannot scrape the complete source code of the web page, so we install a new library selenium
We type:

```
!pip install selenium

```

2)	Import packages

```
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
from selenium.webdriver.support.wait import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options
import re
import time
import json
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from lxml import html
```

### Run Instructions:
1. the main_program.py is the only program that we need to run, other py files are used to be integrated into the main function (generate_packages);
2. To start the program, we need to input the traveler’s information in the input module, including departure city, departure country, destination city code, destination city, destination country, destination code, depart date (MM-DD-YYYY), return date (MM-DD-YYYY), budget, number of adults, number of children, the sorting method (0:by price,1:by rating,2:by recommendation). Format of these input variables need to be paid attention to;
3. For the chromedriver in selenium, we need to download chromedriver.exe and add the path into the parenthesis of driver = webdriver.chrome();
4. It is possible that we visit the web page frequently so that the “robot check “error might be raised, indicating that we visit too frequently to be recognized as an robot, wait for a while before next try may solve this problem;
5. It is possible that opening the webpage and the clicking process might take some time, so please be patient for it to process and do not close the window before it’s done.
